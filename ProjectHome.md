Linear Book Scanner is a prototype automatic book scanning device. The device moves a book face-down over linear sensors to capture page images, and uses vacuum pressure to turn pages automatically as the book moves. See the [original design](https://github.com/google/linear-book-scanner/blob/master/LinearBookScannerDesign.pdf?raw=true).
